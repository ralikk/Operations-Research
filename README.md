<h2>Welcome to the Operations Research Repository!</h2>

<p>This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to a wide range of optimization problems from various areas of Operations Research. The solutions provided here are designed to be accessible to students and practitioners alike, with a focus on clear explanations and practical applications.</p>
<p>In this repository, you will find problems from areas such as linear programming, integer programming, network analysis, and queuing theory, along with detailed solutions
and code examples using solver packages such as IBM CPlex and CVXPY in Python. Our solutions are based on the concepts and techniques outlined in two widely used 
introductory texts in Operations Research: <b>"Introduction to Operations Research" by Frederick S. Hillier and Gerald J. Lieberman</b> and <a href="http://zalamsyah.staff.unja.ac.id/wp-content/uploads/sites/286/2019/11/9-Operations-Research-An-Introduction-10th-Ed.-Hamdy-A-Taha.pdf" target="_blank">"Operations Research: An Introduction" by Hamdy A. Taha</a>.</p>
Our goal is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for those interested in learning about Operations Research and its practical applications. We hope that you find this repository useful and welcome any feedback or suggestions for future problems and solutions.

Thank you for visiting the Operations Research repository, and we hope that it helps to further your understanding of this fascinating field!
